TODO
====

- Improve Html::balanceTags. This is a very naive implementation and does not
  handle singlular tags like <br> or <hr class="whatever">
- Improve Html::excerpt. Check if we're in the middle of an opening tag at the end.
- Add fulltext to builtin page query fields.
- Check JSON values with json schema
